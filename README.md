# Iris Dataset Classification and Visualization

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis and classification of the classic Iris flower dataset using multiple machine learning algorithms. It includes extensive data visualization, model comparison, and detailed performance analysis techniques suitable for educational purposes and machine learning demonstrations.

## Features
- **Multiple classifiers**: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Scatter plot matrix, box plots, violin plots, pairplots, and PCA visualization
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy metrics, classification reports, cross-validation, and confusion matrix analysis
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Decision boundaries, feature importance, learning curves
- **Comprehensive Performance Analysis**: Per-class metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and misclassification rates

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Usage
Simply run the script to generate all visualizations and model comparisons:
```python
python iris_classification.py
